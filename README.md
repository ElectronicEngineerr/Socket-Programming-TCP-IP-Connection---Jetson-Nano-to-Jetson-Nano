![SOCKET PROGRAMMING CONNECTION](https://github.com/ElectronicEngineerr/Socket-Programming-TCP-IP-Connection---Jetson-Nano-to-Jetson-Nano/blob/main/jetson-nano-overview-og.jpg)


We will teach you to communicate with TCP/IP connection, called socket programming, between two jetsons.Of course, the communication protocol called this socket program is not only from jetson nano to jetson nano. If you want, you can establish this connection on two microprocessors with their own interface and send data to one of them.
